                        <p class="mb-3">Toxic beauty standards normalize unrealistic body images that greatly reduce the self-esteem of women. These standards are greatly promoted by the media, celebrities, and fashion industry. Beauty standards have been constantly changing throughout history. For example, during the Roaring 20s, straight and thin figures were considered beautiful. However, curvy hourglass figures were promoted during the Golden Age of Hollywood by actresses. To present days, larger chest and glutes with an hourglass thin body are most encouraged.

                            <p class="mb-0">Females in their adolescents are affected by this issue.  According to our finding, 73.7 percent of respondents ages 16 to 18 stated that they “almost always” or “frequently” use social media. This puts teenagers at a higher risk of being exposed to the unrealistic beauty standards promoted throughout social media. Furthermore, toxic beauty standards can push women to make questionable decisions when it comes to their own unique selves. The unfeasible body standards can lead to eating disorders and mental health problems. Some teenagers skip meals, smoke cigarettes, and vomit to control their weight. Consequently, these disorders can possibly lead to organ damage, developmental delays, and death. Those who struggle to accept themselves are more likely to commit suicide and are guilty of looking in the mirror because they lack self-esteem.
